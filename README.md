***(The project is not perfect, that's why i need your help! View the code and request updates!)***
Password Toolkit is an open-source project written in Python, originally intended to help me learn the Python programming language better. Now my project can be used and modified by anyone, helping others learn as well.
The project shows a list of password-related tools, you can learn how a Brute Force attack works, you can see if the password you are using is strong, and you can create passwords using the password generator.


# 👊 Brute Force Tester 💥
Simulates a brute force atack. ***(does not work like a real brute force atack)***.
Brute force tester is using a list of passwords inside the code, when you enter a password, it searches for the password you entered, in that list, using ***random***.

# 📘 Manual 📖
View info about the tools in PTK and find out what they do.
From the manual you can also see the Q&A menu.

# ❔ How strong is my password ❔

It asks you some questions, that you have to answer with y/n, based on the answers, the program will tell you if your password is weak or strong.

# ❓ How do i protect my passwords ❓
Tips, on protecting your passwords.

Where to put your passwords.
Where you should **NOT** put your passwords.
etc.

# 🖥️ Password generator 💻
Generates a random password using ***random***.
It works by randomly chosing letters, numbers and symbols from a list inside the code and then using ***random*** we chose a random list of letters wich indicate where the numbers, symbols and letters should go, and then, shows the result. It`s that simple!
